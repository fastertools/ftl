- Mergeable: YES

**PR #348: ftl-sdk v0.14.0**  
- Status: Ready to merge (awaiting approval)
- All Rust Lint checks: âœ… PASS
- All Rust Test checks: âœ… PASS
- Mergeable: YES

## The Fix That Worked

### Simple Independent Releases (KISS)
1. **Removed all complex coordination** - No linked-versions, no cargo-workspace, no extra-files
2. **Separate PRs** - Each package gets its own release PR
3. **Standard semver** - ftl-sdk uses `^0.11.1` for ftl-sdk-macros (current crates.io version)
4. **Independent versioning** - Packages can evolve at their own pace

## Release Instructions

### Step 1: Merge ftl-sdk-macros PR (#349)
```bash
# Once approved
gh pr merge 349 --repo fastertools/ftl --squash
```
This will trigger automatic publishing to crates.io

### Step 2: Update ftl-sdk dependency
After ftl-sdk-macros 0.14.0 is on crates.io:
```bash
git checkout main && git pull
git checkout -b update-macros-dep
sed -i '' 's/ftl-sdk-macros = { version = "^0.11.1"/ftl-sdk-macros = { version = "^0.14"/' sdk/rust/Cargo.toml
git add sdk/rust/Cargo.toml
git commit -m "chore: update ftl-sdk-macros to ^0.14"
git push origin update-macros-dep
gh pr create --title "chore: update ftl-sdk-macros dependency to ^0.14" \
  --body "Updates dependency to use newly published version from crates.io"
```

### Step 3: Merge ftl-sdk PR (#348)
After the dependency update PR is merged, PR #348 will rebuild and can be merged.

## Why This Works

- **No coordination needed** - Just like separate repos
- **Standard Rust/Cargo practices** - Nothing special or custom
- **CI passes** - Because we use published crates from crates.io
- **Simple to understand** - Anyone familiar with Rust knows this pattern

## Lessons Learned

1. **KISS wins** - Complex coordination creates more problems than it solves
2. **Standard practices exist for a reason** - Rust ecosystem handles this well already
3. **Separate repos pattern works** - Even in a monorepo, treat packages independently
4. **Release order matters** - Dependencies must be published before dependents

## Future Improvements

Once both packages are at 0.14.0 on crates.io:
- Patch/minor updates will work automatically within semver ranges
- Major version bumps will need dependency update PRs
- This is completely normal and expected in the Rust ecosystem
