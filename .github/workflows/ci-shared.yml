  # This workflow defines shared configuration for rust-cache
  # GitHub Actions cache scoping rules:
  # - Branches can access caches from their base branch (e.g., PRs can use main's cache)
  # - Caches are isolated between different workflows by default
  # - We use shared-key to enable cross-job cache sharing
  # - save-if ensures we only save caches from main to avoid cache pollution
