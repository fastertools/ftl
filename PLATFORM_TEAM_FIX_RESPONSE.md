# Response to FTL-AWS Platform Team

**Subject:** ✅ Fixed - v0.6.1-alpha.1 Released with Module Download Fix

## Quick Summary

**The issue is fixed!** You can now download the module:

```bash
go get github.com/fastertools/ftl-cli@v0.6.1-alpha.1
```

## What We Fixed

1. **Renamed problematic files:**
   - `Screenshot 2025-08-06 at 6.28.27 PM.png` → `Screenshot_2025-08-06_at_6-28-27_PM.png`
   - `Screenshot from 2025-08-08 18-13-13.png` → `Screenshot_from_2025-08-08_18-13-13.png`

2. **Released v0.6.1-alpha.1** with:
   - The Unicode character (U+202F) issue fixed
   - All features from v0.6.0-alpha.1 (pkg/platform API)
   - Module now downloadable via standard go get

## Immediate Action for Your Team

```bash
# Update your go.mod to the fixed version
go get github.com/fastertools/ftl-cli@v0.6.1-alpha.1

# Verify it works
go mod download

# Run your tests
go test ./...
```

## The pkg/platform API is Ready

Now that you can download the module, you have access to the new clean API:

```go
import (
    "github.com/fastertools/ftl-cli/pkg/platform"
    "github.com/fastertools/ftl-cli/pkg/types"
)

// Create client with explicit configuration
config := platform.DefaultConfig()
client := platform.NewClient(config)

// Process deployments
result, err := client.ProcessDeployment(request)
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was a narrow no-break space (Unicode U+202F) in the screenshot filename, likely inserted by macOS when the screenshot was taken. The Go module proxy cannot create zip archives with such characters, making the module undownloadable.

## Prevention Going Forward

We'll implement:
1. Pre-release checks for problematic filenames
2. CI validation to catch Unicode characters in filenames
3. File naming conventions that avoid spaces entirely

## Verification

To verify the fix works:

```bash
# This should now work without errors
go get github.com/fastertools/ftl-cli@v0.6.1-alpha.1
go list -m github.com/fastertools/ftl-cli@v0.6.1-alpha.1
```

## Apologies

We apologize for this blocker. We understand the frustration of being excited about a new API but unable to use it due to a filename issue. This has been a learning experience, and we'll ensure it doesn't happen again.

## Support

If you encounter any other issues:
- The module should now download correctly
- All pkg/platform functionality is available
- Reach out immediately if you hit any other blockers

## Migration Guide

With the download issue fixed, you can now follow the migration guide in `PLATFORM_V0.6.0_RELEASE.md` to adopt the new pkg/platform API.

**Thank you for your patience and for the detailed bug report. The fix is live in v0.6.1-alpha.1!**
