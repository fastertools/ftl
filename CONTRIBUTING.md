- **Include screenshots if relevant**
- **Include your environment details** (OS, Rust version, etc.)

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, please include:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Provide a detailed description of the suggested enhancement**
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the enhancement**
- **Describe the current behavior and expected behavior**
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful**

### Pull Requests

1. Fork https://github.com/fastertools/ftl-cli and checkout a new branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite and linter pass (`make test`, `make lint`)
5. Make sure your code follows the existing style
6. Open the pull request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.89 or later
- Spin CLI (for testing WebAssembly components)
- wasm32-wasip1 target: `rustup target add wasm32-wasip1`

### Building

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fastertools/ftl-cli
cd ftl-cli

# Build from source
make build

# Run tests
make test
```

## Coding Guidelines

### Rust Style

- Follow standard Rust naming conventions
- Use `rustfmt` for formatting: `cargo fmt --all`
- Use `clippy` for linting: `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Add documentation comments for public APIs
- Include examples in documentation where appropriate

### Error Handling

- Use `anyhow::Result` for fallible functions in the CLI
- Provide helpful error messages with context
- Chain errors appropriately using `.context()`

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Add integration tests for CLI commands
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Ensure tests are deterministic and don't depend on external state

Example test:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_feature() {
        // Arrange
        let input = "test";
        
        // Act
        let result = process(input);
        
        // Assert
        assert_eq!(result, expected);
    }
}
```

### Documentation

- Add inline documentation for all public items
- Include examples in documentation
- Update README.md if adding new features
- Notable changes will be tracked in GitHub releases

## Architecture Decisions

### Key Design Principles

1. **Simplicity First**: Make the common case easy
2. **WebAssembly Optimized**: Every decision should consider WASM performance
3. **Tool Isolation**: One tool per server for security and performance
4. **Runtime Abstraction**: Spin is an implementation detail, not a core dependency

### Adding New Commands

When adding a new CLI command:

1. Add the command to the `Commands` enum in `cli/src/main.rs`
2. Create the corresponding wrapper struct with clap derives in `cli/src/main.rs`
3. Implement the `From` trait to convert CLI types to command types
4. Create the implementation in the appropriate module under `crates/commands/src/`
5. Add tests for the command
