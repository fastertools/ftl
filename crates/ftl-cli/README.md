# FTL CLI

This crate contains the command-line interface for the FTL framework. It provides a complete developer experience for the entire lifecycle of creating, testing, and deploying WebAssembly-based tools for AI agents.

## Features

- **Tool Scaffolding:** `ftl new` creates a new tool from a template.
- **Building:** `ftl build` compiles your Rust code into an optimized WebAssembly component.
- **Local Development:** `ftl serve` starts a local server with hot reloading for rapid development and testing.
- **Deployment:** `ftl deploy` pushes your tool to the FTL Edge platform.
- **Toolkit Management:** `ftl toolkit` commands allow you to bundle multiple tools into a single deployable unit.

## Usage

The `ftl` CLI is the primary entry point for developers using the FTL platform. For installation and usage instructions, please see the main project [README.md](../README.md) and the [documentation](../docs).
