## Coding Standards

### General Principles
- **Security first**: No unsafe code without exceptional justification
- **Performance matters**: Optimize for startup time and memory usage
- **User experience**: Simple commands, clear error messages
- **Backward compatibility**: Don't break existing projects without migration path

### Rust Code
- Follow `cargo fmt` formatting
- Pass all `cargo clippy` lints
- No `panic!()`, `unwrap()`, or `expect()` in production code
- Comprehensive error handling with context
- Document public APIs with examples

### Go Code  
- Use `gofmt` for formatting
- Pass `go vet` and `golint` checks
- Follow Go naming conventions
- Include benchmarks for performance-critical code

### Python Code
- Use `black` for code formatting  
- Pass `ruff` linting checks
- Type hints for all public functions
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Comprehensive docstrings

### Documentation
- Clear, concise writing
- Working code examples
- Screenshots for UI changes
- Cross-references to related topics

## Testing Requirements

All contributions must include appropriate tests:

### Unit Tests
- Test individual functions and components
- Cover both success and failure cases
- Mock external dependencies
- Fast execution (< 1 second per test)

### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Use real FTL CLI commands
- Verify end-to-end workflows
- Test in CI environment

### Documentation Tests
- Ensure all code examples work
- Test installation instructions
- Verify links and references
- Check formatting and grammar

## Review Process

### What Reviewers Look For

**Functionality**:
- Does the code solve the stated problem?
- Are edge cases handled properly?
- Is error handling comprehensive?

**Code Quality**:
