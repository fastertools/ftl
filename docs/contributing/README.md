## Getting Started

### Development Setup
Learn how to set up your development environment:
- We are still working on a clean local development flow. For the moment I just copy paste wasm locations into the CLI build commands!

### Contribution Process
- Any contributions at this stage are welcome.
- **Pull request workflow** - From fork to merge

### [Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.md)
