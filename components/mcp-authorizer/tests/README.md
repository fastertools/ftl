# MCP Authorizer Test Suite

This test suite provides comprehensive testing for the MCP Authorizer component, achieving parity with FastMCP's JWT provider test coverage.

## Test Structure

### Unit Tests (Rust/WASM)

Located in `src/`, these tests use the spin-test SDK to test the component in isolation:

- `jwt_tests.rs` - Basic JWT validation tests
- `jwt_verification_tests.rs` - Comprehensive JWT verification with mocked JWKS
- `jwks_caching_tests.rs` - JWKS caching behavior tests
- `error_response_tests.rs` - Error response format validation
- `oauth_discovery_tests.rs` - OAuth discovery endpoint tests
- `provider_config_tests.rs` - Provider configuration validation

### Integration Tests (Python)

Located in the tests root directory:

- `run_integration_tests.py` - Comprehensive integration tests matching FastMCP coverage
- `jwt_test_helper.py` - JWT token generation utility
- `integration_test.sh` - Basic shell script for quick testing

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites

1. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Ensure Spin is installed and available in PATH

### Running Unit Tests

**Note**: Due to WASI version compatibility issues between spin-test SDK and Spin 3.x, 
unit tests currently face compilation challenges. Use integration tests for comprehensive coverage.

```bash
# Build the test component
cd tests
cargo component build --release

# Run tests (currently has WASI compatibility issues)
cd ..
spin test
```

### Running Integration Tests

1. **Quick smoke test**:
   ```bash
   ./tests/integration_test.sh
   ```

2. **Comprehensive test suite**:
   ```bash
   python tests/run_integration_tests.py
   ```

3. **Generate test JWT tokens**:
   ```bash
   # Generate a valid token
   python tests/jwt_test_helper.py

   # Generate an expired token
   python tests/jwt_test_helper.py --expired

   # Generate JWKS
   python tests/jwt_test_helper.py --action jwks

   # Generate with custom claims
   python tests/jwt_test_helper.py --subject user123 --scopes read write admin
   ```

## Test Coverage

The test suite covers all scenarios from FastMCP's JWT provider tests:

### Token Validation
- ✓ Valid token with JWKS verification
- ✓ Expired token rejection
- ✓ Invalid signature rejection
- ✓ Wrong issuer rejection
- ✓ Wrong audience rejection
- ✓ Multiple audiences validation
- ✓ Malformed token rejection

### Scope Handling
- ✓ Scope extraction from 'scope' claim
- ✓ Scope extraction from 'scp' claim (Microsoft style)
- ✓ Array and string scope formats
- ✓ Scope precedence rules

### JWKS Features
- ✓ JWKS endpoint fetching
- ✓ JWKS caching with TTL
- ✓ Key ID (kid) matching
- ✓ Multiple keys in JWKS

### Configuration
- ✓ Provider requires key or JWKS URI
- ✓ String issuer support (RFC 7519)
- ✓ Optional issuer/audience validation
- ✓ Multiple expected audiences

### Error Handling
- ✓ Proper HTTP status codes
- ✓ WWW-Authenticate header format
- ✓ JSON error responses
- ✓ CORS support

## Known Issues

1. **WASI Version Mismatch**: The spin-test SDK currently has compatibility issues with Spin 3.x due to WASI interface version differences. This prevents the Rust unit tests from running directly.

2. **Dynamic Configuration**: Integration tests cannot dynamically change provider configuration (issuer, JWKS URI, etc.) as these are set via environment variables at startup.

## Workarounds

For comprehensive testing, use the Python integration test suite which:
- Starts a real Spin instance
- Tests all HTTP endpoints
- Validates error responses
- Can mock external services (JWKS endpoints)

## Future Improvements

1. Update spin-test SDK when compatible with Spin 3.x
2. Add test coverage reporting
3. Create mock MCP gateway component for end-to-end testing
4. Add performance benchmarks
5. Implement property-based testing for edge cases
